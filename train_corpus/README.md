## Training corpus

This folder contains the training corpus used for the initial French automatic annotation phase.
This training corpus is a modified version of [the one used during PARSEME Shared Task 1.1](https://gitlab.com/parseme/sharedtask-data/-/tree/master/1.1/FR).
The annotations used during this Shared Task (`LVC`, `VID`, etc.) have been removed and replaced with our own `COLL` annotations for verb-noun collocations according to [our guidelines](https://github.com/b-giordano/thesis_cpac/tree/main/annotation_guidelines).
Below are the stats for this training corpus:

* Sentences: 17,225
* Tokens: 432,389
* Total annotations: 958
* Total unique collocations: 469
