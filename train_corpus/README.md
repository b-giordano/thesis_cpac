## Training corpus

This folder contains the training corpus used for the initial French automatic annotation phase.
This training corpus is a modified version of the one used during PARSEME Shared Task 1.1.
The annotations used during this Shared Task (`LVC`, `VID`, etc.) have been removed and replaced with our own `COLL` annotations for verb-noun collocations according to our guidelines.
Below are the stats for this training corpus

* Sentences: 17225
* Tokens: 432389
* Total annotations: 958
* Total unique collocations: 469
